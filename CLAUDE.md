# Agent FC Landing Page

## Project Overview

Build a single-page landing site for **Agent FC** - the world's first AI agent-owned football club.

## What is Agent FC?

Agent FC is a decentralized initiative to acquire and operate a real professional football club in Brazil, governed by AI agents and owned collectively by a coalition of agents and aligned humans.

**The thesis:** If agents can run a football club, they can run anything. This is proof that autonomous agents can own, govern, and grow real-world assets.

**Key points to communicate:**
1. First agent-owned football club in history
2. Real club acquisition in Brazil (SAF law enables this)
3. Community ownership via token governance
4. AI agents handle operations, humans handle football
5. Not a meme - this is infrastructure for the agent economy

## Target Audience

- AI/ML developers and researchers
- Web3/crypto natives interested in real-world assets
- Football fans curious about new ownership models
- Agents (yes, AI agents browsing the web)

## Content Sections (Single Page)

### Hero
- Strong headline conveying the mission
- One-liner subhead
- Single CTA: "Join the Waitlist" (email capture)
- No fake social links

### The Thesis
- Brief explanation of why this matters
- "If agents can run a football club, they can run anything"

### How It Works (3 pillars)
1. **Agents Operate** - AI agents handle day-to-day decisions
2. **Community Owns** - Token holders are the ultimate authority  
3. **Experts Execute** - Human professionals run football operations

### Why Brazil
- SAF law enables clean acquisitions
- 10x cheaper than Europe
- 215M population, football as religion

### The Model
- Brief reference to Wrexham's 2,200% revenue growth
- "We're applying that playbook with agent governance"

### Waitlist CTA
- Email capture form
- "Be first to know when we announce the club"

### Footer
- Simple, minimal
- No fake social links - leave placeholders like "Twitter coming soon" or just omit

## Design Guidelines

### DO:
- Clean, minimal, confident design
- Bold typography - let the words breathe
- High contrast (dark backgrounds work well for sports/web3)
- Editorial feel - like a manifesto, not a product page
- Strong imagery if used (football fields, stadiums, aerial shots)
- Subtle motion (scroll-triggered fades, not bouncy animations)
- Trust through restraint - less is more

### DO NOT:
- Purple/blue gradients (AI slop aesthetic)
- Glowing orbs, floating particles
- Bouncy/springy animations
- Glassmorphism overdone
- "Web3" clichés (connecting dots, abstract networks)
- Fake testimonials or logos
- Broken links or placeholder links that go nowhere

### Visual References (Vibe):
- Nike/Adidas campaign sites (bold, confident, editorial)
- The Athletic (clean sports journalism)
- A24 movie sites (minimal, mysterious, confident)
- Modern football club sites (Real Madrid, Man City - premium feel)

### Color Palette Suggestion:
- Primary: Deep black (#0a0a0a) or very dark navy
- Accent: One strong color (consider club colors once selected, for now use a confident green or gold)
- Text: Clean white/off-white
- Avoid: Neon, purple, excessive blue gradients

### Typography:
- Strong sans-serif for headlines (Inter, Satoshi, or similar)
- Clean readable body text
- Let whitespace do the work

## Technical Requirements

- Single HTML file is fine (or simple React/Next if preferred)
- Mobile responsive
- Fast loading (minimal JS)
- Email form can be a simple mailto: or Formspree integration
- No backend required for v1

## Deliverables

1. `index.html` (or equivalent)
2. `styles.css` (or Tailwind)
3. Any necessary assets
4. README with setup instructions

## Tone of Voice

- Confident, not hype
- Inevitable, not speculative  
- "This is happening" not "Wouldn't it be cool if"
- Direct, clear language
- No exclamation marks
- No "revolutionary" or "game-changing" fluff

## Example Headlines (for inspiration, write your own):

- "The first football club owned by AI agents"
- "Agents don't just assist. They own."
- "A football club. Run by agents. Owned by the community."
- "If agents can run a football club, they can run anything."

Build this landing page with the confidence and restraint of a manifesto, not the hype of a token launch.
